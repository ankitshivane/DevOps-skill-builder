Installing Docker to use with the AWS SAM CLI

steps:

Installing Docker

1. Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.


$ sudo yum update -y
Install the most recent Docker Community Edition package.

For Amazon Linux 2, run the following:

$ sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
For Amazon Linux 2023, run the following:

OR

$ sudo yum install -y docker
Start the Docker service.


$ sudo service docker start
Add the ec2-user to the docker group so that you can run Docker commands without using sudo.


$ sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

Configure Docker to start on boot with systemd
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service

Pick up the new docker group permissions by logging out and logging back in again. To do this, close your current SSH terminal window and reconnect to your instance in a new one. Your new SSH session should have the appropriate docker group permissions.

Verify that the ec2-user can run Docker commands without using sudo.


$ docker ps
