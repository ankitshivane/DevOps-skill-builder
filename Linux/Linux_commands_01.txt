man
help

cd
pwd
rm	
	options 
	rm : generally we use rm command to delete files but if it is used with -rf option then it will delete folders also without asking or giving any error. it will delete forecefully and recursive manner, it will delete the directory including sub directory also
	-i : it will prompt before every removal for confirmation as y or n if you give y then only it will delete else it will terminate.

rmdir : it removes empty directory
	options:
	-p : it helps to remove directory and its sub-directory for example the p4 directory contain p5 so to remove p4 and p5 use below cmd: rmdir -p p4/p5/ 
	here it will delete non empty directory with this command if the directory is empty then it will not delete it and throw an error that the directory is non empty
	-v : its a verbose means it will show each and every step of execution
	
tree (sudo yum install tree -y)
mkdir with -p option
ls command
	options
		-l : list the content in long list format where details are present in alphabetical order file or directory name
		-r : gives content in reverse or recursive order of file or directory name
		-i : it prints the inode number of each file
	
du -h : this command will give information of how much space is consumed by each directory including hidden ones present under current directory.

File management
1. Cat

we cat utility we can create a new file, add content to the existing file and also we can view the content of the existing file.
but we can not modify the content of existing file using cat utility.

cat > fileName ::: it will create a new file everytime and if you are providing a existing file name then it will override the existing content with new content.

for saving press ctrl + d and to cancel press ctrl + C but it will create a file till current content even if you have press ctrl + c.


2. more and less command
more command : more is one of the oldest terminal pagers in the UNIX ecosystem. Originally, more could only scroll down  but now we can use it to scroll up one screen-full at a time, and scroll down either one line or one screen-full
less command : using less command we can toggle the content of the screen in both the directions

3. cp command:
it is use to copy the files from source to destination place

option
	i : using this we can mention that whether we need to overrite the file present in the destination or not? it will ask us for confirmation using y or n 
	cp -i sourceFile destinationFile
	
4. head and tail command
by default head command show us the first 10 lines of the file whereas the tail command show us the last 10 lines of the file
but there is one option available as -n using which we can specify the number of lines to view.

5. Hard link and soft link in linux

	a. Hard Links: command to create-> ln originalFileName hardLinkFileName
	2. hard link will create ordinary file.  
 
3. Hard link will have same i-node number, time stamp, file 
permission and size like original file 
  
4. Hard link can be created on local file system i.e on local 
partition.  
 
5. If original file is deleted,hard link will remain active.  
 
6. Once hard link is created it will increase Link count of 
original file and hard link.  
 
7. Hard link can be observed using command  
#ls -li 

	b. Soft Link or Symlink or Symbolic link 
 
 
1.    Command :  
# ln–s  <Orig file Name>  <Link name>  
NOTE: here note is the link_name should be specified with the complete absolute path starting from root folder otherwise soft link wont be created properly. 
 
2. Soft link will create new shortcut.  
 
3. Soft link will have different i-node number, time 
stamp, file permission and size.  
 
4. Soft link can be created across different partitions.  
 
5. If original file is deleted, renamed or moved than /softlinkis of no use. but if you create a file with the same name as the original deleted file then the soft link will start working. 
 
6. Softlink does not increases link count but it will 
show the name of original file with arrow sign and also indicate “l” as file type before file permissions.  


7. Soft link can be observed using command  
# ls –li
