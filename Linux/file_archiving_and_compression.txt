file archiving and compression in linux

Archiving and compressing files are common operations in the Unix world, done by system administrators on a very regular basis.

Luckily for you, Linux exposes a set of different commands in order to archive, compress, uncompress and extract files from an archive.

A. Archive files on Linux using tar
Tar is a very popular command among system administrators.the tar command does not compress .tar files. tar just bundles up
the files into a single archived file. Therefore, if you ever see a file ending in just ‘.tar’, you already know that
the archive process applied no compression on the files contained within that archive.

The tar command has a few more options than the zip command did. The most commonly used options for the tar command
includes the following:

-c: creates a new .tar archive file
-v: verbosely shows the tar process so you can see all the steps in the process
-f: specifies the file name type of the archive file
-x: extracts files from an existing .tar file
-t: --list, it will list the contents of an archive

a.
The following example shows the basic syntax of the tar command to create an archive:
$ tar -cvf <name of archive file>.tar <directory to archive or files to archive>

tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2 file3

b. list the content of archive file using -t:

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-192 p2]$ tar -tvf archive.tar
-rw-r--r-- ec2-user/ec2-user 19559749 2024-07-24 09:53 file3
-rw-r--r-- ec2-user/ec2-user 19559749 2024-07-24 09:55 file4
-rw-r--r-- ec2-user/ec2-user 19559749 2024-07-24 09:55 file5

c. extract the content of the file using -x

Note: if you do not use -f option in all above command then it will thorw us an error and it wont be able to guess the archive file name.
